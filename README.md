# Superhero Game

This Superhero game is a basic adaptation from a card based game called "Trunfo". Each player receive an equal amount of super hero cards, then for each round a player chooses the best attribute for that hero. If his attribute is higher than the other player, he gets his current card plus the adversary's and put them in the end of his cards queue. The game ends when a player has lost all of their cards.

Here, only the human player will choose the attributes, because yes xD
